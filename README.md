# TaskManager
A very simple to do based application. Used to track your daily tasks.

### Why I made this project
This projects purpose is to be used as a method of learning Flutter and Dart. It allows the ability to get hands on with development after researching techniques and ways of doing things. It is likely that many of the features will undergo constant refactoring simply to learn new ways of doing things, or a more proper way of doing a current feature.

## Features
### Primary
- [x] Default filter to view all Groups/Tasks
- [x] Create Task
- [ ] Archive Task
- [x] Delete Task
- [ ] Update Task
- [x] Create Filter
- [x] Create Tag
- [x] User Settings
    * - [ ] Archive before deleting tasks
    * - [x] Dark Mode
    
### Filters and Tags
By using a combination of tags a user can create filters to display the desired tasks.
Ex: While developing this app the tag bug was added to tasks describing the discovered issue. A filter was then created so only those bugs would show up and no other tasks.
    
## Current State
As of right now it is a functional application and soon to be available on android.

## Future State
Going forward the above primary features are where my focus will be.
