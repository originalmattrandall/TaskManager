# TaskManager
A very simple to do based application. Used to track your daily tasks or maybe even a shopping list.

### Why I made this project
The entire purpose behind this to do app was to learn the Flutter and Dart languages. I wanted to make sure the project had a need to use a database and something that could leverage the BLoC pattern.
